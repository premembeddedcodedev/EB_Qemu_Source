	default n
	help
	  Enable support for the ARM long descriptor pagetable format.
	  This allocator supports 4K/2M/1G, 16K/32M and 64K/512M page
	  sizes at both stage-1 and stage-2, as well as address spaces
	  up to 48-bits in size.

config CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_LPAE_SELFTEST
	bool "LPAE selftests"
	depends on CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_LPAE
	default n
	help
	  Enable self-tests for LPAE page table allocator. This performs
	  a series of page-table consistency checks during boot.

	  If unsure, say N here.

config CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_ARMV7S
	bool "ARMv7/v8 Short Descriptor Format"
	select CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE
	depends on (CONFIG_ARM32VE || CONFIG_ARM64)
	help
	  Enable support for the ARM Short-descriptor pagetable format.
	  This supports 32-bit virtual and physical addresses mapped using
	  2-level tables with 4KB pages/1MB sections, and contiguous entries
	  for 64KB pages/16MB supersections if indicated by the IOMMU driver.

config CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_ARMV7S_SELFTEST
	bool "ARMv7s selftests"
	depends on CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_ARMV7S
	help
	  Enable self-tests for ARMv7s page table allocator. This performs
	  a series of page-table consistency checks during boot.

	  If unsure, say N here.

config CONFIG_IPMMU_VMSA
	bool "Renesas VMSA-compatible IPMMU"
	depends on (CONFIG_ARM32VE || CONFIG_ARM64)
	select CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_LPAE
	help
	  Support for the Renesas VMSA-compatible IPMMU Renesas found in the
	  R-Mobile APE6 and R-Car H2/M2 SoCs.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CONFIG_ARM_SMMU
       bool "ARM Ltd. System MMU (SMMU) Support"
       depends on (CONFIG_ARM32VE || CONFIG_ARM64)
       select CONFIG_IOMMU_IO_PGTABLE_LPAE
       help
	  Support for implementations of the ARM System MMU architecture
	  versions 1 and 2.

	  Say Y here if your SoC includes an IOMMU device implementing
	  the ARM SMMU architecture.
