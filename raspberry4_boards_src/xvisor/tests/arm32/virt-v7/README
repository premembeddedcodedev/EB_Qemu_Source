			Virt-v7 Guest

The Virt-v7 is a fully para-virtualized guest with Cortex-A15 CPUs.

We only have memory mapped VirtIO devices for IO and this makes the
Guest as fully para-virtualized.

The memory map and irqs in Virt-v7 guest is as follows:
0x0000000000000000-0x0000000007FFFFFF (128M)        (NOR Flash)
0x0000000008000000–0x000000000800FFFF (64K)         (GIC Dist Interface)
0x0000000008010000–0x000000000801FFFF (64K)         (GIC CPU Interface)

In addition, we also have ARMv7 generic timer accessible to all VCPUs
of the Guest with virtual timer irq 27 and physical timer irq 30.
