config CONFIG_HPET
	bool "High Precision Event Timer"
	help
        HPET is a hardware timer available in personal computers
        since 2005. Your system would mostly have it. If it does
        not choose other timers.

config CONFIG_LAPIC_TIMER
        bool "Local APIC Timer"
	depends on CONFIG_LOCAL_APIC
        help
            Use Local APIC timer as the system timer. While most new
            processors would have Local APIC usable as system timer
            there are few older (not too old) processors that do not
            support counters in Local APIC Timer. Such LAPIC timers
            cannot be used in High Resolution timer configurations.
            If this is the default timer, system on the fly will
            check if Local APIC timer can be used as system timer.
